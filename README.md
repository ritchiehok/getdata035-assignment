run_analysis.R performs the following steps:

#####Reads in data
* Reads in column headers (features.txt), activity labels (activity_labels.txt), subject numbers (subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt), activity readings (X_test.txt and X_train.txt) and activity numbers (Y_test.txt and Y_train.txt)
for the test and training sets

#####Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Column binds the subject numbers, activity numbers and activity readings
* 

#####Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
*

#####Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*

#####Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
*

#####From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
*
